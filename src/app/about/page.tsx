            I innovate as an entrepreneur, but have worked in some of the largest and most bureaucratic organizations in the world. I spent my college life at a military institute as a civilian, much of my working life in one of the oldest banks in America, and my free time in refugee camps, ashrams and temples across the world. 
            </p>            
            <p>
            While these may seem like a paradoxical collection of experiences, in reality they represent the intersection of political, business, and thought leaders, whose coordination and perspective is required for global innovation and change.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I was 16, I worked with Chinese factories, big-box retailers in the U.S., and online companies such as eBay and Amazon to develop two successful businesses before I graduated high school. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I began to travel the East in my 20s and developed a deep affinity for ancient Eastern philosophy. This started with research in Syrian refugee communities and later led me to study and live in China, completing a masters degree as a Schwarzman Scholar, and India where I lived in an ashram in Himalaya and sat with the Dali Lama.  
            </p>
            <p>
            For the past 5 years, I built an incubation program inside J.P. Morgan Chase. I co-founded the program, helped grow the team from 2 to 40+ people with a global presence, and guided many ideas from 0 to 1 as a product manager (and sometimes designer, engineer, and QA). It was an incredible experience to develop and scale digital solutions for an institution started in 1799. 
            </p>
            <p>
            This juxtaposition of ancient wisdom and cutting-edge innovation has helped me find balance within myself and illuminated the path toward crafting meaningful, impactful products for a global user base.
